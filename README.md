# arabicvocab

My running Arabic vocab list.

I don't speak Arabic, but I do teach students who do.

I do Duolingo, and my vocabulary choices may be biased.

I'm interested in vocabulary used by people in Yemen, really.

I'm also interested in making all of the harakat correct, so please, make corrections if you are able and you see an issue that can't be chalked up to regionality.
